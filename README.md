# deeplab
DeepLab is a semantic segmentation Deep Learning algorithm. Implementation is copied from tenserflow/../research/deeplab on GitHub.


> This is a self-help guide for using DeepLab model for semantic segmentation in TensorFlow. Github-TensorFlow has provided DeepLab model for research use.

## Installation
Download the DeepLab code:

https://github.com/tensorflow/models

## DeepLab depends on the following libraries
- Numpy
- Pillow 1.0
- Jupyter notebook
- Matplotlib
- Tensorflow

## Pre-trained model
We have used the the frozen graph trained on PASCAL VOC 2012 Semantic Segmentation Dataset.
